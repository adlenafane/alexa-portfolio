                            We did a great work in a minimum amount of time. The low priority project became an important part of the business. Thinking about what I could do better, I would say spending time to do some guerilla test but moslty thinking to the expected variations and minimize customization: each retailer wanted specific icons, colors and fonts to respect their own e-commerce website guidelines.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Next time, I will test ideas and obviously be more careful with the feature expectations like personnalization to anticipate the come up evolution.
